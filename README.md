# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In this project, I will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. I will use the PyTorch deep learning library and the Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle.

Step 1: Install PyTorch and other dependencies
First, you will need to install PyTorch and other dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib tqdm

Step 2: Download the Cats vs Dogs dataset
Next, you will need to download the Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). The dataset consists of 25,000 images of dogs and cats, split into a training set and a test set.

Step 3: Preprocess the data
Before you can use the data to train your CNN, you will need to preprocess it. This involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, and normalizing the pixel values of the images. 

Step 4: Define the CNN model
Next, you will define the CNN model using PyTorch. You can use a pre-trained model such as VGG16 or ResNet, or you can define your own CNN from scratch. 

Step 5: Train the model
To train the model, you will need to define an optimizer and a loss function, and then call the fit method of the model object and pass it the training data and labels. You can also specify the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset) and the batch size (the number of samples per gradient update) to use during training.

Step 6: Evaluate the model: Once the model has been trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test data by calling the 'evaluate' method.
